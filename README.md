# Huffman-Encryption
## Overview
This project implements the Huffman coding algorithm in C++ to compress text files. Huffman coding is a popular method of lossless data compression. It uses variable-length codes to represent characters based on their frequencies in the input data.

## Features
Compress text files using Huffman coding.

## Getting Started
